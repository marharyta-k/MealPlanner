HI!
I can help you make your weekly meal planning easier. 

The logic of the app is based on the idea of a balanced diet:
- for each breakfast it takes 1 carbohydrate, 1 protein, 1 vegetable and 1 fruit or berry;
- for each lunch 1 bean type product, 1 vegetable and 1 fruit or berry;
- for each dinner 1 carbohydrate, 1 protein, 1 vegetable and 1 fruit or berry.
This can be used as a base for your meals to maintain a varied diet, which is important for your gut health and microbiome. 

This script takes different food products from food.csv, organised in food groups. 

You may want to substitute products you do not regulary eat with the ones you prefer, or the ones you already have at home. This can be made in Food_for_meal_planner_app.xlsx file. Be careful to maintain food groups, and so far it is important to have the same number of foods. After you've made the changes, save file as csv with the name food.csv. 

Now we are ready to run the script.

Open cmd in current directory, print 'python meal_planner.py' and hit enter. 
Print your name, hit enter. 
Congrats! Now your meal plan for the week is ready in the file in the output directory!
You can also look through the plan in terminal by printing 'yes'. 

If you run the script once again, a new menu will be generated. 

There are many ways for this app to be made better. A few following steps may be:
- making it possible to have any amount of product names
- creating database for the app 
- finding recipes online based on the products chosen for the meal etc. 

Hope this app will help you make your diet more diverse and improve your gut health.
